JavaScript Promise

Promise (readable)
=======

==> Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) 
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

==> Promise actually attaches function nor pass like callback, we have complete control
with us in it.

==> Promise is just like a container for future values.

==> Promise is placeholder until receive values from asyncronous operation.

==> Promise contains result & state.

==> Result consists on reslove & reject

==> A Promise is in one of these states:

. Pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
. Fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
. Rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
